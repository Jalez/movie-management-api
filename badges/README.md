# Coverage Badges

This directory contains automatically generated JaCoCo coverage badges for the project.

## How it works

The badges are generated by the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/jacoco-badge.yml` which:

1. Runs after successful CI/CD pipeline completion
2. Downloads the build artifacts containing JaCoCo reports
3. Generates coverage badges using the `cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator` action
4. Commits the updated badges back to the repository

## Badge files

- `jacoco.svg` - Overall code coverage percentage
- `branches.svg` - Branch coverage percentage  
- `functions.svg` - Function coverage percentage
- `lines.svg` - Line coverage percentage

## Usage in README

You can include these badges in your main README.md like this:

```markdown
![JaCoCo](badges/jacoco.svg)
![Branches](badges/branches.svg)
![Functions](badges/functions.svg)
![Lines](badges/lines.svg)
```
